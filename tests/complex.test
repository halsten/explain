# - This "useless use of cat" allows us to make use of here-documents.
#   That way, we can write down the input and output without having to
#   care about quotes.
# - These here-documents don't have a final newline on the very last
#   line. Hence, the "echo" calls in "suite.sh" must NOT add a "-n".
